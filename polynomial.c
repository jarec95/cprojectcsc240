/*

Create a C file called polynomial.c that defines the following functions:
poly_t * new_polynomial()  that allocates memory for a new polynomial.  
void print_polynomial(const poly_t * poly)  prints a polynomial.  You do not need to print the terms in any specific order.
void add_to_polynomial(poly_t * poly, const term_t * term)  adds a term to the polynomial.  
poly_t * combine_like_terms(const poly_t * poly)  returns a new polynomial resulting from combining the like terms in the parameter polynomial poly.  
void delete_polynomial(poly_t ** poly)  that frees memory allocated for a  polynomial
